# Portfolios_exposures - The theme is is to find the Beta Estimates of Sectoral Portfolios.
## 11 sectors as per GIS definitions , and so we have 11 sectoral portfolios with 5 stocks each.
## Fama-French 3 factos been used to determine the Beta estimates(Rolling estimates) 
### Naive Portfolios :- This based on equal weight allocation 
### Alternative Portfolios : This is based on Minimum Variance and Maximum Returns 
#### Additional Portfolios :- Ray Dalio's All Weather/Season's Portfolio, 60/40, Golden Butterfly and .... for subsequent additions
## Subsequent additions would be to estimate the portfolio returns using Macro-Economic-Variables(cpi,unrate,bondrate,lead indicators)
